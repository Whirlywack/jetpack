# Formulate Task Status Update for Jetpack Havoc

The following task(s) from `../../specs/04_MVP_Task_List.md` has/have been addressed or worked on:

* **Task ID(s):** `[INSERT TASK ID(s) HERE]`
* **Summary of Work Accomplished During This Session:**
    `[YOU OR THE AI SHOULD BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT WAS DONE, e.g., "Implemented initial energy deduction logic for jetpack." or "Fixed bug related to enemy collision."]`

Based on the work accomplished, please help formulate the updated line(s) for the `../../specs/04_MVP_Task_List.md`.

The target format for each task in the task list is:
`* TASK-XXX: [Original Task Description] [STATUS: <STATUS_VALUE>] [COMPLETED_DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] [Notes: Optional short notes]`

For each Task ID listed above, please determine:
1.  The new **`STATUS`**:
    * `TODO`: If work hasn't meaningfully started or needs a full restart.
    * `IN PROGRESS`: If partially completed and more work is pending.
    * `DONE`: If all requirements for this task are met.
    * `BLOCKED`: If progress cannot continue without resolving an issue (please specify the blocker in notes).
2.  If the new `STATUS` is `DONE`, the **`COMPLETED_DATE`**. (Today is {{YYYY-MM-DD}} - *replace with actual date or have AI use current date*).
3.  Any concise **`Notes`** that should be added. Examples:
    * "Initial implementation complete, unit testing pending."
    * "Integrated with Player scene, basic functionality confirmed."
    * "Blocked pending clarification on X from `../session_brief.md`."
    * "Refactored X for clarity."

**Output:**
Please provide the full, updated line(s) for `../../specs/04_MVP_Task_List.md` for each of the Task ID(s) mentioned above.

**Example Output:**
`* TASK-108: Implement input handling (e.g., Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept")) for a single jump/jetpack boost in Player.gd. [STATUS: DONE] [COMPLETED_DATE: 2025-05-07] [Notes: Input successfully triggers placeholder action.]`
`* TASK-109: Implement upward velocity application for jetpack boost in Player.gd. [STATUS: IN PROGRESS] [Notes: Basic upward movement on input, needs physics refinement.]`
