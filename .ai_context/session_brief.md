# Jetpack Havoc MVP - AI Session Brief

**Date:** 2025-05-07 12:30
**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Initials]

## 1. Overall Goal for This Session

* To successfully initialize the Git repository for the Jetpack Havoc project, establishing version control from the outset.

## 2. Current Task(s) in Focus

* **Task ID(s):** `TASK-001` from `../../specs/04_MVP_Task_List.md`
* **Description:** "Initialize Git repository for the project."
* **Status:** Not started

## 3. Key Reference Documents & Files for These Tasks

* **Specifications:**
  * `../../specs/02_MVP_Technical_Design_and_Architecture.md` (Section 10. Project Folder Structure - for context, though less direct for this task)
* **Existing Project Files (if relevant):**
  * (None yet, as this is the first task)

## 4. Recently Completed Tasks (Summary of last 1-3 relevant tasks)

* (None yet - this is the first task of the project)

## 5. Current Blockers / Questions / Points to Clarify

* Do we need to create a `.gitignore` file immediately? If so, what common Godot/macOS/Windows files should be ignored?
* Will the repository be hosted on a specific platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)? If so, should remote setup be part of this initial task?

## 6. Next Immediate Tasks (After current focus is complete)

* `TASK-002`: Create Godot 4.x project structure (folders for scenes, scripts, art, resources).

## 7. Key Decisions/Notes from Last Interaction (Brief)

* (N/A - First session)
